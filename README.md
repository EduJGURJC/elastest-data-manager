=================

The EDM is responsible for installing, managing and uninstalling the different persistent services available for the whole ElasTest platform.

The persistent services under the responsibility of EDM are the following:

- Relational database (MySQL)
- Persistance control service (API-including Alluxio, S3 & HDFS compatible)
- ElasticSearch (for both logs and metrics)
- API for exporting and importing data

## Start this component using docker-compose
Note: your terminal need to be in the main project folder where the docker-compose.yml is located.

You can start this image using docker-compose. It will start the following:

- One HDFS namenode
- One HDFS datanode
- One Alluxio master
- One Alluxio worker
- An Elasticsearch cluster (with two nodes)
- A Cerebro instance (web tool for monitoring and administering the Elasticsearch cluster )
- A Kibana instance
- A MySQL instance

You have the possibility to scale the number of HDFS datanodes, Alluxio workers and Elasticsearch nodes.

### Preparing the Linux host
If you are in a Linux host, you need to set vm.max_map_count to at least 262144  in order to run the Elasticsearch container. (more info at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode).

You can use the following helper script to do that:

    # From main project folder
    
    # Start component (in detached mode)
    ./prepare-linux-host.sh
    
In order to change your system settings, the script will prompt you for your sudo password.
    
### Starting the component
    # From main project folder
    
    # Start component (in detached mode)
    docker-compose up -d 
    
    # View service status
    docker-compose ps
    
    # View logs
    docker-compose logs

### Accessing the web interfaces
Each component provide its own web UI. Open you browser at one of the URLs below, where `dockerhost` is the name / IP of the host running the docker daemon. If using Linux, this is the IP of your linux box. If using OSX or Windows (via Boot2docker), you can find out your docker host by typing `boot2docker ip`. On my machine, the NameNode UI is accessible at `http://192.168.59.103:50070/`

| Component               | Port                                               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| HDFS NameNode           | [http://localhost:50070](http://localhost:50070) |
| Alluxio Web Interface| [http://localhost:19999](http://localhost:19999) |
| Kibana Web Interface| [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) |
| Cerebro Web Interface| [http://localhost:9400/#/overview?host=http:%2F%2Felasticsearch:9200](http://localhost:9400/#/overview?host=http:%2F%2Felasticsearch:9200) |

### Scaling the number of instances
If you want to increase the number of HDFS datanodes in your cluster

    docker-compose scale hdfs-datanode=<number of instances>

If you want to increase the number of Alluxio workers in your cluster

    docker-compose scale alluxio-worker=<number of instances>

If you want to increase the number of Elasticsearch nodes in your cluster

    docker-compose scale esnode=<number of instances>
    
### Finding the port for web access of scalable
To allow worker instances (such as the hdfs-datanode, the alluxio-worker or the esnode) to scale, we need to let docker decide the port used on the host machine. 

For example, to find the port for the hdfs-datanode:

    docker-compose port hdfs-datanode 50075

With this port, you can access the web interfaces of the datanode.

### Accessing the Alluxio REST API
The Alluxio REST API is available at http://localhost:39999

You can try the following examples:

	# From main project folder
	
	# Upload file (local)
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/paths//LICENSE/create-file
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/1/write --data-binary @LICENSE -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/1/close

	# Upload file (HDFS)
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/paths//hdfs/LICENSE/create-file
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/2/write --data-binary @LICENSE -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/2/close

	# Read file (local)
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/paths//LICENSE/open-file
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/3/read
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/3/close
	
	# Read file (HDFS)
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/paths//hdfs/LICENSE/open-file
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/4/read
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/4/close

	# Delete file (local)
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/paths//LICENSE/delete

	# Delete file (HDFS)
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/paths//hdfs/LICENSE/delete
