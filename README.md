elastest-data-manager
=================

The EDM is responsible for installing, managing and uninstalling the different persistent services available for the whole ElasTest platform.

The persistent services under the responsibility of EDM are the following:

- Relational database (MySQL)
- Persistance control service (API-including Alluxio, S3 & HDFS compatible)
- ElasticSearch (for both logs and metrics)
- API for exporting and importing data

## Prerequisites
- Install Docker Compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
- Install Git: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git

### Clone the project
    # Clone the project to your system
    # Alternatively, you can download the zip file from Github and unzip it
    git clone https://github.com/elastest/elastest-data-manager.git

    # Change working directory to main project folder
    cd elastest-data-manager

### Prepare your environment

    # From main project folder
    
    # Make scripts executable
    chmod +x bin/* 
       
## Start this component using docker-compose
Note: your terminal need to be in the main project folder where the docker-compose.yml is located.

You can start this image using docker-compose. It will start the following:

- One HDFS namenode
- One HDFS datanode
- One Alluxio master
- One Alluxio worker
- An Elasticsearch cluster (with two nodes)
- A Cerebro instance (web tool for monitoring and administering the Elasticsearch cluster )
- A Kibana instance
- A MySQL instance

You have the possibility to scale the number of HDFS datanodes, Alluxio workers and Elasticsearch nodes.

    # From main project folder
    
    # Start component
    bin/startup-linux.sh
    
    # View service status
    docker-compose -p edm ps
    
    # View logs
    docker-compose -p edm logs

Please note that it will take some time (in the order of several seconds - depending on your system) for all the services to be fully available. 

Also note that if you are in a Linux host, you need to set vm.max_map_count of the host to at least 262144  in order to run the Elasticsearch container. (more info at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html#docker-cli-run-prod-mode). If you use the above startup-linux.sh script you don't have to do anything extra since it already contains code to do this. However, in order to be able to change your system settings, the script will prompt you for your sudo password.

### Accessing the web interfaces
Each component provide its own web UI. Open you browser at one of the URLs below, where `dockerhost` is the name / IP of the host running the docker daemon. If using Linux, this is the IP of your linux box. If using OSX or Windows (via Boot2docker), you can find out your docker host by typing `boot2docker ip`. 

| Component               | Port                                               |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| HDFS NameNode           | [http://localhost:50070](http://localhost:50070) |
| Alluxio Web Interface| [http://localhost:19999](http://localhost:19999) |
| Kibana Web Interface| [http://localhost:5601](http://localhost:5601) |
| Cerebro Web Interface| [http://localhost:9400/#/overview?host=http:%2F%2Felasticsearch:9200](http://localhost:9400/#/overview?host=http:%2F%2Felasticsearch:9200) |

### Scaling the number of instances
If you want to increase the number of HDFS datanodes in your cluster

   docker-compose -p edm scale hdfs-datanode=<number of instances>

If you want to increase the number of Alluxio workers in your cluster

    docker-compose -p edm scale alluxio-worker=<number of instances>
   
### Finding the port for web access of scalable containers
To allow worker instances (such as the hdfs-datanode, the alluxio-worker or the esnode) to scale, we need to let docker decide the port used on the host machine. 

For example, to find the port for the hdfs-datanode:

    docker-compose -p edm port hdfs-datanode 50075

With this port, you can access the web interfaces of the datanode.

### Accessing the Alluxio REST API
The Alluxio REST API is available at http://localhost:39999

You can try the following examples:

	# From main project folder
	
	# Upload file (local)
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/paths//LICENSE/create-file
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/1/write --data-binary @LICENSE -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/1/close

	# Upload file (HDFS)
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/paths//hdfs/LICENSE/create-file
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/2/write --data-binary @LICENSE -H "Content-Type: application/octet-stream"
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/2/close

	# Read file (local)
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/paths//LICENSE/open-file
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/3/read
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/3/close
	
	# Read file (HDFS)
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/paths//hdfs/LICENSE/open-file
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/4/read
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/streams/4/close

	# Delete file (local)
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/paths//LICENSE/delete

	# Delete file (HDFS)
	curl -v -X POST http://localhost:39999/api/v1/paths//hdfs/LICENSE/delete

### Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch is listening at localhost:9200 if you want to access it with your own client interface. 
For example you can install the Sense Chrome plugin https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sense-beta/lhjgkmllcaadmopgmanpapmpjgmfcfig?hl=en).

You can also connect to it and run queries through the provided Cerebro Web Interface. 
In order to connect to Elasticsearch from Cerebro use hostname: elasticsearch and port: 9200

### MySQL
MySQL Server is listening at localhost:3306.

You can connect to it with user: elastest and password: elastest

A database elastest is already created and you can use it for your schemas.

## Stop this component using docker-compose

    # From main project folder
    
    # Teardown component
    bin/teardown-linux.sh
